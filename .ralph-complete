21black - Terminal Blackjack Game (Complete)

Built a full-featured terminal blackjack game in pure Node.js (zero dependencies):

- src/game.js (505 lines): Complete game engine with deck creation, shuffling, dealing,
  hand evaluation, player actions (hit/stand/double/split), dealer logic, bet settlement,
  session statistics, and all edge cases.

- src/renderer.js (737 lines): ANSI terminal renderer with card ASCII art, box-frame UI,
  color-coded displays, welcome/betting/game/result/game-over screens, split hand rendering.

- src/index.js (372 lines): Game loop with readline input, signal handling, dramatic dealer
  pauses, CLI flags (--help/--version), and graceful terminal management.

- src/game.test.js (2702 lines): 263 tests across 21 suites covering all game logic.

All 57 implementation plan items complete. All tests passing.
